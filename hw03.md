# **Binary Code**

1) int8_t x = 67; int8_t y = -7; int8_t z = y - x;

x = 01000011, y = 11111001, z = 10110110.

No overflow error.

2) int8_t x = 0xd3;

x = 11010011.

x overflows.

3) uint8_t x = 0xd3;

x = 11010011.

No overflow error.

4) int8_t x = 127; int8_t y = -7; int8_t z = y â€“ x;

x = 01111111, y = 11111001, z = 01111010.

z overflows.

5) float x = 1.125;

x = 0 01111111 00100000000000000000000

No overflow error. No accuracy error.

6) float x = 23.0;

x = 0 10000011 01110000000000000000000

No overflow error. No accuracy error.

7) float x = 0.45;

x = 0 01111101 11001100110011001100110

No overflow error. x has an accuracy error.

# **Explanation of Some Words**

The following explanations are all from Wikipedia.

## *Method of complements*

In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers.

## *Byte*

The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number.

## *Integer (computer science)*

In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.

## *Floating point*

In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision.
